        <h1>Types Of Heart Disease</h1>
    </nav>
    <p>
        There are several different types of heart disease, and they affect the heart in different ways.

        The sections below will look at some different types of heart disease in more detail.
    </p>
    <h2 class="navbar navbar-dark  bg-danger">Coronary artery disease</h2>
    <p>
        Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart disease.

        It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged with plaque. This causes them to
        harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol and other substances.

        As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients. In time, the
        heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.

        When plaque builds up in the arteries, this is called atherosclerosis.
    </p>
    <h2 class="navbar navbar-dark bg-danger">Congenital heart defects</h2>
    <p>
        A person with a congenital heart defect is born with a heart problem. There are many types of congenital heart
        defect, including:

        Abnormal heart valves: Valves may not open properly or may leak blood.
        Septal defects: There is a hole in the wall between either the lower chambers or the upper chambers of the
        heart.
        Atresia: One of the heart valves is missing.
        Congenital heart disease can involve major structural issues, such as the absence of a ventricle and problems
        with the main arteries that leave the heart.

        Many congenital heart problems do not cause any noticeable symptoms and only become apparent during a routine
        medical check.

        According to the American Heart Association (AHA), heart murmurs often affect children, but only some are due to
        a defect.
    </p>
    <h2 class="navbar navbar-dark bg-danger">Arrhythmia</h2>
    <p>
        Arrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeat. It occurs when the electrical impulses that coordinate the
        heartbeat do not work properly. As a result, the heart may beat too fast, too slowly, or erratically.

        There are various types of arrhythmia, including:

        Tachycardia: This refers to a rapid heartbeat.
        Bradycardia: This refers to a slow heartbeat.
        Premature contractions: This refers to an early heartbeat.
        Atrial fibrillation: This is a type of irregular heartbeat.
        A person may notice a feeling like a fluttering or a racing heart.

        Brief changes in heart rhythm are not a cause for concern, but treatment will be necessary if they persist, as
        this can affect the heartâ€™s function.
